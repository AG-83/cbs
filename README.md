# Red Cross: Community Based Surveillance (CBS)

Join the world’s largest humanitarian organisation and code for the greater good!

**The challenge:**
Public health crises, such as disease outbreaks and famine, most often occur where health systems and public health surveillance is weak. Emergencies, whether sudden or slow onset, increase people’s vulnerabilities to health risks and infectious disease can quickly spread and cause life threatening outbreaks.

**The solution:**
Community Based Surveillance (CBS) allows communities, volunteers and the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement to identify and alert of potential outbreaks themselves. This means that we can respond to emerging public health crises much quicker and therefore prevent excess death and illness.
