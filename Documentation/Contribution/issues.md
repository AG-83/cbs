# Issues

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Backlog

Any issues MUST be associated with a [project](../Projects/index.md). Every project has its own
backlog and is the thing that the products owners prioritize from. It is also the thing that product
owners will fill out all the details and have discussions around.

## Ready

Once a backlog item is ready to be implemented it lives in the *Ready* column. One SHALL NOT start
implementing anything that is not in this column. It means the product owner does not consider it
ready and not prioritized. If you feel differently or has information to share in the work item/issue,
please do so directly on the issue as we encourage full transparency on this.
