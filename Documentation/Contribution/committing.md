# Committing

## Issue

All commits should be related to an issue. By adding a #{number of issue} to the comment you relate to it and
one can track what code is related to an issue for transparency. It also helps you as a developer focus around
developing only issues that are needed. At times you might find yourself in a position of needing to fix a
technical issue and its not necessarily something that needs a full orchestration of priority and all, then
all you need to do is register the issue on the projects repository and then relate to it.
