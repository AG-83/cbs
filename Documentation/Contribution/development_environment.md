“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Git

Everything is Git based. Some Ideas have it installed, some operating systems as well. If you need the
basic CLI client - download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## .NET Core

The backend code is written using C# and .NET. below are the best choices for getting up and running fast.
Download and install the [.NET Core 2.0 SDK and runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).

### Visual Studio Code

Open source, cross platform editor:
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor. More info [here](./visual_studio_code.md).

### Visual Studio 2017 or for Mac

You can use the free, community edition as an IDE if you like - download it from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).

## Docker

Everything is being developed with Docker in mind, and in fact you can get something that resembles the
production environment pretty easily as things are packaged up and ready to be used.

Download the Community Edition from [here](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community).

## MongoDB

[MongoChef / Studio3T](https://studio3t.com) is a great tool - supports cross platform.
For using this with Azure and CosmosDB, there is a write-up [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-mongochef)

## Terminal

Any terminal and git. To get quickly up and running, suggested options are [cmder]([http://cmder.net/]) on Windows and [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) on Mac.
