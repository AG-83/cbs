# Identity and Access

Making sure only users and systems that should have access are authenticated and have the correct authorization is
considered its own [bounded context](bounded_contexts.md). We will rely on third party software based on open standards
for dealing with this.

## Standards

## OAUTH2 + OpenID

## Azure Active Directory

### B2C

### Single Sign On

## Identity Server
